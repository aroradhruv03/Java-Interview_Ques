# Java Interview Ques / Practice

A small project (for now), to help others practice the various Java Interview questions I find & code.

_**The best way to learn is not to read just the theory, but to code!**_

*_As I've just started. Project is still in initialization phase. Please wait before I keep adding questions here._
